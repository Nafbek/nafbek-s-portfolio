This is a repo for portfolio challenge

# <Week One Code Refactor Challenge II>

## Description

This is a project aimed at building my personal portfolio page from scratch, based on the acceptance criteria. At this stage, I have used placeholders as I do not have any web applications to showcase. However, these will eventually be replaced by actual works as I continue to develop applications.

### User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

###  Acceptance Criteria (It is a given)

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Credits

I am grateful to my tutor, Juan Torres, for assisting me in refining the flexbox layout of the top-links section by suggesting to make the anchor element wrap the mini-box section instead of placing it inside the section, and using the media queries to determine the flex-direction of the navigation links. Additionally, I would like to acknowledge Philip Clark for helping me adjust the margin of the work-container. 

I would also like to give credit to the following external sources that were used in this project:
